# Team 6 project 2: LoveatFirstFlight

## Overview:
As a group, we have collectively developed a user blog for traveling. Our intentions with this application is to create an interactive map of the United States. This application has the ability to select specific states and mark them as either a state you have been to or wanting to travel to. Additionally, you are also enabled to input blog/reviews about states you have traveled to as well.


## Process:

1. Seek a target audience/demograph.

2. Develope a concept/user blog based on or target audience.

3. Create a live user-friendly login screen that directs them to our main hub.

4. Create our main hub where they can interact with our map.

5. Develope modules that  will help store user information inside of our database.

6. Polish UI with a coding Framework.

7. Publish Site.

## User Story:
