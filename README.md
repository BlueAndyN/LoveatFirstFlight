# Team 6 project 2: LoveatFirstFlight

## Overview:
As a group, we have collectively developed a user blog for traveling. Our intentions with this application is to create an interactive map of the United States. This application has the ability to select specific states and mark them as either a state you have been to or wanting to travel to. Additionally, you are also enabled to see other users and where they have traveled to. Overall this application will help organize and visualize your travels across the United States. 

## Process:

1. Seek a target audience/demograph.

2. Develope a concept/user blog based on or target audience.

3. Create a live user-friendly login screen that directs them to our main hub.

4. Create our main hub where they can interact with our map.

5. Develope modales that will help store user information inside of our database.

6. Get user data to post live feed.

7. Change the map appearance with the correspoding user information/input.
 
8. Polish UI.

9. Publish Site.
